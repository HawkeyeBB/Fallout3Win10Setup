#### Prologue
Many of these steps have been taken from others guides and notes. I will list some of them in the footnotes(special thanks to, section) at the end of this document. By using their information, I was able to test and verify this document. I would not have known the proper way to install Fallout 3 on Windows 10 without their help and previous work. Thank you.. <3
